 * Fizz Buzz
   Your program has to print numbers from 0 to 18.
   If a number is a multiple of three, mark it: Fizz.
   If a number is a multiple of five, mark it: Buzz.
   If a number is a multiple of three and five, mark it: FizzBuzz.
 * 
 * Task 1
   Make a for loop that counts from 0 to 18 and print each number.
 * 
 * Task 2
   Set up an if - else if - else statement.
   if the number is a multiple of three, mark it: Fizz.
   if the number is a multiple of five, mark it: Buzz.
   if the number is a multiple of three and five, mark it: FizzBuzz.
 * 
 * Hints:
   A number is a multiple of X if number ÷ X results in a remainder of zero.
   There are three conditions for Fizz, Buzz, and FizzBuzz. Be careful about their order. If something is FizzBuzz, it also satisfies the conditions for Fizz and Buzz.
